Sample input parameters tested:
1600 200 50 5000
1000 100 50 5000
10000 10 50 1000

My programs do not deadlock as I explicitly chose to use the tryLock() method whenever I attempted to lock a coordinate using a Java ReentrantLock. tryLock() acquires the lock if it is free, otherwise the thread continues and does not wait on the lock (unlike the lock() method). This guarantees that the "hold and wait" condition for deadlock is unfulfilled, which avoids the possibility of a circular wait.
